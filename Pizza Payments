/* Kate and Michael want to buy a pizza and share it. Depending on the price of the pizza, they are going to divide the costs:
If the pizza is less than €5,- Michael invites Kate, so Michael pays the full price.
Otherwise Kate will contribute 1/3 of the price, but no more than €10 (she's broke :-) and Michael pays the rest.
How much is Michael going to pay? Calculate the amount with two decimals, if necessary. */

  if (cost > 30) { return Math.round((cost-10)* 100) /100; }
  else { return Math.round(cost * 2/3 * 100) /100; }
